This repository contains a simple C program that demonstrates an integer overflow bug. The program initializes an integer variable 'i' to 1 and then assigns the address of 'i' to an integer pointer 'ptr'. The value pointed to by 'ptr' is then updated to 2. The program then prints the value of 'i'.  The potential bug is that if the variable 'i' were to be incremented repeatedly without a check for integer overflow, the program could unexpectedly behave in an unpredictable manner. This is a common error that can lead to unexpected results and security vulnerabilities. The bugSolution.c file provides a solution that prevents integer overflow by checking the value before incrementing.
